    paraOne: 'WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service encouraged thousands of tax-exempt organizations today to file their taxes ahead of their filing deadline.',
    paraTwo: "The annual filing due date for certain returns filed by tax-exempt organizations is normally by the 15th day of the 5th month after the end of an organization's accounting period. Those operating on a calendar year (CY) basis must file a return by May 15.",
    title: 'Common errors',
    paraThree: 'IRS encourages organizations to review their forms for accuracy and to submit complete returns. If an organization’s return is incomplete or the wrong return for the organization, the return will be rejected. Common errors include missing or incomplete schedules.',
    titleTwo: 'Extension of time to file',
    paraFour: 'Tax-exempt organizations may request a six-month automatic extension by filing a Form 8868, Application for Extension of Time to File an Exempt Organization Return. In situations where tax is due, extending the time for filing a return does not extend the time for paying tax.',
    paraFive: 'IRS provides a series of pre-recorded online workshops to help exempt organizations comply with their filing requirements. These workshops are designed to assist officers, board members and volunteers with the steps they need to take to maintain their tax-exempt status, including filing annual information returns.',
